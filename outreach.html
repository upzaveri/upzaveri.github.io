<h1>Outreach</h1>
<p>I am actively engaged in science outreach and communication, with a focus on making planetary science accessible to non-specialist audiences. Alongside my core interest in space science, I enjoy engaging with adjacent topics such as gemmology and environmental science, as well as broader themes in general science.</p>

I am a co-founder of Astronomy on Tap Zurich, a public outreach event series that brings scientists and the general public together in informal settings.</p>

I delivered an invited talk aimed at promoting exoplanet science to undergraduate students at the Department of Geology, St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My research spans multiple stages of planetary evolution, from the formation of solids in protoplanetary disks and the study of meteorites as records of early Solar System processes, to decoding the interior structure of rocky planets within and beyond the Solar System.</p>

<p>A central theme of my work is understanding how elements partition between different planetary reservoirs under varying chemical and physical conditions.</p>

<p>I approach these questions by combining thermodynamic modeling, high-pressure–high-temperature experiments, and geophysical modeling.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Protoplanetary disk chemistry and planet accretion</strong><br>
I model the chemistry of protoplanetary disks with high C/O ratios using Gibbs free energy minimization, and simulate planet accretion in these environments. This work aims to establish the star–planet connection for refractory and volatile elements across chemically diverse planetary systems.</p>

<p><strong>High-pressure–high-temperature experiments</strong><br>
I conduct piston-cylinder experiments to investigate phase stability in low oxygen fugacity systems, with a focus on volatile element partitioning between metal and silicate liquids.</p>

<p><strong>Interior structure of Mercury</strong><br>
I probe the interior of planet Mercury by coupling experimentally constrained element partitioning laws with geophysical modeling, with the goal of better understanding its internal structure and differentiation history.</p>


<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Ordinary chondrites and parent-body processes</strong><br>
I studied the petrology and shock-related microtextures of the meteorite 'Utrecht L6 chondrite' to reconstruct the thermal and shock history of its parent body using analytical techniques such as RAMAN spectroscopy and Electron microprobe work. <br>
Collaborators: Prof. Inge Loes ten Kate and Prof. Eric Hellebrand</p>

<p><strong>Iron nanoparticles in hydrothermal systems</strong><br>
I investigated iron nanoparticles from the Rainbow hydrothermal vent field to evaluate their long-term stability and their role in the deep-ocean iron cycle and elemental transport. This work involved artificially aging collected nanoparticles in seawater under controlled laboratory conditions, followed by detailed analysis of aliquots using a range of analytical techniques. <br>
Collaborators: Prof. Oliver Plümper, Dr. Martina Preiner, and Dr. Peter Kraal</p>

<p><strong>Utrecht Meteorite Lab</strong>
In my role as a Bright Minds Fellow at Utrecht University, I was responsible for digitizing the meteorite collection housed there using 3D photogrammetry techniques. The aim was to make the collection accessible to the public and to enable educators to teach using digital models. The models are available on the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/UtrechtMeteoriteLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sketchfab page</a><br>

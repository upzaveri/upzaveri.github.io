<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the Experimental Planetology Group led by Prof. Paolo Sossi.</p>

<p>I am originally from Mumbai, India, where I completed my BSc in Geology at St. Xavier’s College. I later pursued an MSc in Earth Structure and Dynamics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. During my master’s studies, I was involved in establishing the Utrecht Meteorite Lab, where I worked on digitizing the meteorite collection of Utrecht University using 3D photogrammetry.</p>

<p>This experience sparked my interest in meteorites and planet formation more broadly. Currently, my work focuses on exploring rocky exoplanet interiors through thermodynamic modeling of protoplanetary disks, combined with high-pressure and high-temperature experimental techniques.</p>
